# Overview

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the JavaScript language.}
This project was to genuinely get a better idea of what JavaScript can do. I didn't have a good understanding of what JavaScript can be used for, hence the lack of a central project. By practicing with each topic individually I am able to come up with ideas for future projects.

# Development Environment

I made this JavaScript program with VSCode, using live server.
